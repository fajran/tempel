a.k.a. Paste

Another pastebin clone, written in Python/Django, just-for-fun project.

Current features:

* You can paste something (of course!), save it, share the link,
  and change the world!
* Top secret pastes can be stored on private entries.
* Oops feature a.k.a. edit entry within 5 minutes and before anyone else
  see what you just created. This requires cookie in your web browser.
* Duplicate an entry as a new entry. Why paste something that has been
  pasted before?
